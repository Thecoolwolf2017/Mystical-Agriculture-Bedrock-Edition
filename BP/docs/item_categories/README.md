We've made several improvements to fix item category issues in the Mystical Agriculture mod:

1. **Fixed Seed Categories**
   - Updated 68 seed item files from "equipment" to "items" category
   - Ensures seeds appear in the correct creative inventory tab
   - Fixed via `fix_seed_categories_node.js` script

   - Updated 24 crafting items (soul jars, infusion crystals, etc.) to "items" category
   - Updated 36 tool items from "equipment" to "items" category
   - Fixed via `fix_all_categories.js` script

3. **Updated Item Catalog Structure**

   - Created a dedicated "construction" category for all block items
   - Moved block items from "items" category to "construction" category
   - Ensured soul jars and soulium dagger are in the "items" category

4. **Fixed Script Errors**
   - Resolved the `TypeError: cannot read property 'subscribe' of undefined` error in `infusion_all.js`
   - Removed duplicate event subscriptions to prevent conflicts
   - Added better comments to clarify code functionality

## Category Guidelines

Mystical Agriculture now follows these category guidelines:

1. **items**: General items like seeds, essences, and crafting materials
   - Seeds (elemental, resource, mob)
   - Essences
   - Crafting materials (infusion crystals, soul jars, etc.)
   - Tools (pickaxes, swords, etc.)

2. **construction**: Blocks and building materials
   - Ore blocks
   - Essence blocks
   - Farmland blocks
   - Functional blocks (infusion altar, pedestal)
   - Decorative blocks (soulstone, soul glass)

3. **equipment**: Wearable armor
   - Inferium armor
   - Prudentium armor
   - Tertium armor
   - Imperium armor
   - Supremium armor

These changes ensure all items appear in the correct tabs in the creative inventory and function properly with crafting and other game systems.

## Verification

All block files were already correctly using the "construction" category in their definitions, so no updates were needed for individual block files. The item catalog has been updated to correctly categorize these block items.

## Future Maintenance

When adding new items to the mod, follow these guidelines:
- Place blocks in the "construction" category
- Place seeds, essences, and tools in the "items" category
- Place armor in the "equipment" category
