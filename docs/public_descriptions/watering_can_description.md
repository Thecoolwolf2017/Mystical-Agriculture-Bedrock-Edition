# Watering Can

By interacting with any vanilla or new crop, you can use a watering can to progressively grow it until it matures. The watering can needs to be filled with water before use and will empty after each use.

## How to Use:

1. **Fill the Watering Can**: Right-click on a water block to fill your watering can.
2. **Use on Crops**: 
   - Use directly on a crop to advance its growth stage
   - Use on farmland to water multiple crops in an area (size depends on the watering can tier)
3. **Refill**: After use, the watering can will be empty and need to be refilled.

## Watering Can Tiers:

- **Inferium Watering Can**: Waters a 3×3 area
- **Prudentium Watering Can**: Waters a 5×5 area
- **Intermedium Watering Can**: Waters a 7×7 area
- **Superium Watering Can**: Waters a 9×9 area
- **Supremium Watering Can**: Waters a 11×11 area

Higher tier watering cans also have a better chance of advancing crop growth!

## Tips:

- The watering can works with both vanilla Minecraft crops and custom Mystical Agriculture crops
- When used directly on a custom crop, it will immediately advance its growth stage
- Visual particles will show when a crop has been successfully watered
- Check the action bar for helpful messages about your watering can's status
