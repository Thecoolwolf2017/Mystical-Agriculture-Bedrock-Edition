# Ore System Improvements

This document outlines recent improvements to the ore system in Mystical Agriculture Bedrock Edition.

## 1. Ore XP System

### Implementation Details

The ore XP system has been completely refactored to use a global event handler instead of relying on custom components.

**Key Improvements:**
- Switched to a global `world.beforeEvents.playerBreakBlock` event handler
- Fixed XP drops by detecting ore blocks before they're destroyed
- Implemented proper randomized XP amounts based on ore type
- Added position randomization for a more natural effect

**Location:** `BP/scripts/utils/oreUtils.js`

### XP Drop Amounts

Different ore types drop different amounts of XP:

| Ore Type | XP Amount |
|----------|-----------|
| Diamond/Emerald | 3-7 XP |
| Lapis | 2-5 XP |
| Redstone | 1-5 XP |
| Gold/Quartz/Coal | 0-2 XP |
| Iron/Copper | 0-1 XP |
| Prosperity/Inferium/Soulium | 1-3 XP |

### Technical Notes

- For backward compatibility, the `strat:ore_xp` component is still registered but does nothing
- The `handleOreXpDrop` function is kept as a stub for backward compatibility
- Debug logging helps track XP drops with messages in the console

## 2. Deepslate Ore Texture Fixes

### Deepslate Prosperity Ore

#### Issue and Solution

The deepslate prosperity ore texture was not displaying correctly due to two issues:

1. The texture file didn't exist in the resource pack
2. The block definition had unnecessary geometry references

**Solution:**
- Created the missing texture file at `RP/textures/blocks/deepslate_prosperity_ore.png`
- Simplified the block definition to match the working prosperity ore

**Location:** `BP/blocks/ore/deepslate_prosperity_ore.json`

#### Block Definition Changes

The block definition was updated to use a simpler and more consistent structure:

```json
"minecraft:material_instances": {
    "*": {
        "texture": "deepslate_prosperity_ore",
        "render_method": "opaque",
        "face_dimming": false
    }
}
```

### Deepslate Inferium Ore

#### Issue and Solution

The deepslate inferium ore was not appearing in the creative menu and displayed an unknown texture when placed. The issues were:

1. Missing entry in the `blocks.json` file
2. Missing proper menu category in the block definition
3. Missing display name for proper identification

**Solution:**
- Added the block entry to `RP/blocks.json`:
```json
"strat:deepslate_inferium_ore": {
    "sound": "deepslate",
    "textures": "deepslate_inferium_ore"
}
```
- Added proper menu categorization to ensure it appears in the creative inventory
- Added a display name component for better identification

**Location:** 
- `BP/blocks/ore/deepslate_inferium_ore.json` 
- `RP/blocks.json`
- `RP/texts/en_US.lang`

## Additional Documentation

- `docs/ore_features.md` - General information about ore features
- `BP/scripts/utils/oreUtils.js` - Source code for the ore XP system

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to consider:
- Add particle effects when mining ore blocks
- Implement custom sound effects for different ore types
- Add configuration options for XP drop amounts
