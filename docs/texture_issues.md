# Texture Issues and Fixes

## Deepslate Inferium Ore Texture Issue

### Problem
The deepslate inferium ore block was showing an unknown texture in-game.

### Investigation
1. Texture file exists at: `RP\textures\blocks\inferium\deepslate_inferium_ore.png`
2. Texture is correctly referenced in `terrain_texture.json` as `deepslate_inferium_ore`
3. Block definition in `BP\blocks\ore\deepslate_inferium_ore.json` refers to the texture as `deepslate_inferium_ore`
4. Regular inferium ore texture is defined in `terrain_texture.json` (around line 111)

### Solution
The issue was related to texture references in the resource pack:

1. Verified that both texture files exist in their expected locations:
   - `RP\textures\blocks\inferium\inferium_ore.png`
   - `RP\textures\blocks\inferium\deepslate_inferium_ore.png`

2. Confirmed that the entries in `terrain_texture.json` are correct:
   ```json
   "inferium_ore": {
       "textures": [
           "textures/blocks/inferium/inferium_ore"
       ]
   },
   ```
   ```json
   "deepslate_inferium_ore": {
       "textures": [
           "textures/blocks/inferium/deepslate_inferium_ore"
       ]
   },
   ```

3. Enhanced the deepslate inferium ore block definition with explicit render method properties:
   ```json
   "minecraft:material_instances": {
       "*": {
           "texture": "deepslate_inferium_ore",
           "render_method": "opaque",
           "face_dimming": true
       }
   },
   ```

4. Removed an accidentally created duplicate texture reference.

## Other Texture Fixes

If additional texture issues are encountered, consider the following common solutions:

1. Ensure the texture file exists in the expected location
2. Make sure the texture is registered in `terrain_texture.json`
3. Check that the block definition correctly references the texture name
4. Update material instances with proper rendering properties if needed
5. Avoid duplicate texture entries in the terrain_texture.json file
