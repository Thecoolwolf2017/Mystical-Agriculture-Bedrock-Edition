# Item Categories in Mystical Agriculture

## Category Guidelines

Mystical Agriculture uses three main item categories to organize items in the creative inventory:

1. **items**: General items like seeds, essences, and crafting materials
   - Seeds (elemental, resource, mob)
   - Essences
   - Crafting materials (infusion crystals, soul jars, etc.)
   - Tools (pickaxes, swords, etc.)

2. **construction**: Blocks and building materials
   - Ore blocks
   - Essence blocks
   - Farmland blocks
   - Functional blocks (infusion altar, pedestal)
   - Decorative blocks (soulstone, soul glass)

3. **equipment**: Wearable armor
   - Inferium armor
   - Prudentium armor
   - Tertium armor
   - Imperium armor
   - Supremium armor

## Item Catalog Structure

The item catalog in `BP/item_catalog/crafting_item_catalog.json` organizes items into these categories and further groups them by type.

### Items Category
- Elemental Seeds
- Resource Seeds
- Mob Seeds
- Materials
- Tools

### Construction Category
- Blocks (including ores, essence blocks, farmland, and functional blocks)

### Equipment Category
- Armor sets

## Recent Updates

The item catalog and individual item files have been updated to ensure all items are in the correct categories:
- All seed items moved from "equipment" to "items"
- All essence items set to "items"
- All block items moved from "items" to "construction"
- All tool items set to "items"
- All armor items set to "equipment"

These changes ensure items appear in the correct tabs in the creative inventory and function properly with crafting and other game systems.
